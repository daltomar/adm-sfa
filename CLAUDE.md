# CLAUDE.md

Project memory and working instructions for Claude Code in this repository.

## What this project is

A desktop application (Rust) for a small charitable project that tracks physical
skateboard-related donations, dual-currency (EUR/BRL) cash flow, purchases, and
outbound donations to recipient projects in Brazil. Single user, single machine,
no sync required.

**Read `SPEC.md` before making any architectural or data-model decision.** It is
the source of truth for entities, fields, the document/filename system, and
reporting requirements. It was produced through detailed back-and-forth with the
project owner — treat it as settled unless explicitly told otherwise in this
session. Do not redesign the data model from scratch; extend or implement what's
there.

## Status

- Functional specification: complete (`SPEC.md`).
- Rust stack: **decided.** See `stack-plan.md` for the chosen storage layer
  (`rusqlite` + `rusqlite_migration`), UI framework (`egui`/`eframe`), PDF
  library (`typst-as-lib` + `typst-bake`, with a fallback noted if the bake
  step proves too unstable), backup mechanism (`zip` + `walkdir`), and the
  first-draft `schema.sql`. Section 6 of `SPEC.md` is left unchanged as
  historical context on what was deferred — `stack-plan.md` is the current
  source of truth for tech choices.
- No code has been written yet.

## How to work in this repo

1. On starting a session, read `SPEC.md` and `stack-plan.md` in full before
   proposing or writing anything.
2. If a requested feature isn't covered by `SPEC.md`, say so explicitly and ask
   rather than inventing new entities or fields silently.
3. The stack is decided — see `stack-plan.md`. Do not re-litigate storage
   layer, UI framework, or PDF library choices without explicit instruction.
   If `schema.sql` / `migrations/001_initial.sql` don't yet exist in the repo,
   create them from `stack-plan.md`'s schema section before writing any other
   code.
4. Keep `SPEC.md`, `stack-plan.md`, and the actual schema/code in sync. If
   implementation reveals an ambiguity or necessary change to the spec or
   plan, flag it and propose an edit rather than letting the code silently
   diverge.

## Non-negotiable design constraints (do not change without explicit confirmation)

- **Two independent cash ledgers** (EUR and BRL). Currency conversion happens
  only at the annual EUR→BRL transfer, with a manually entered exchange rate.
  Never introduce a live FX rate dependency.
- **No hardcoded purchase channels.** Kleinanzeigen is the common case but
  purchases are generic (`channel` as free text + `seller_info` as a generic
  note field), for both EUR and BRL purchases.
- **Donors, recipient projects, and item categories are first-class entities**,
  not free text — required for reporting (esp. per-donor breakdowns). Item
  categories live in a `category` table with an FK from `inventory_item`, not
  a hardcoded enum/CHECK constraint.
- **Document labels are config-driven**, not a hardcoded source-level const —
  they live in a `document_label` table, seeded at migration time, so adding
  a label is a row insert. `document.label` itself stores the name as TEXT
  (not an FK) so historical documents stay valid if a label is later renamed
  or retired.
- **Documents are file-on-disk, not BLOBs**, stored flat in `documents/` with
  auto-generated filenames (see SPEC.md §4.2) — never prompt the user to type a
  filename.
- **Soft-delete only** for documents — move to `documents/_deleted/`, never
  hard-delete from within the app.
- **Single user.** Do not add multi-user auth, sync, or concurrent-write
  handling — out of scope.

## Conventions once code exists

- **Module layout** (see `stack-plan.md` for the full tree): `db/` for
  `rusqlite` access and query modules per entity group, `model/` for plain
  structs mirroring DB rows (including `category` and `document_label` as
  first-class models, not enums), `ui/views/` for one file per section
  (including `settings.rs` for category/label management), `ui/widgets/` for
  shared components (`document_panel.rs`, `amount_field.rs`), `reports/` for
  PDF/CSV generation, `docs_fs.rs` for filename generation and soft-delete,
  `backup.rs` for the zip-based backup.
- **Migrations**: `rusqlite_migration`, tracked via `schema.sql` (canonical,
  hand-maintained) kept in sync with `migrations/NNN_name.sql` (applied,
  incremental). New tables/columns get a new migration file, not edits to
  `001_initial.sql` once it's applied anywhere.
- **Money**: `rust_decimal`, stored as TEXT in SQLite — never use SQLite
  NUMERIC/REAL for money fields.
- **Table declaration order** in schema files should stay forward-reference
  free where practical (a table shouldn't `REFERENCES` a table declared later)
  even though SQLite itself resolves FK targets at DML time — keeps the
  schema portable to stricter tooling/linters.
- **Dependency versions**: check `stack-plan.md`'s pinned versions before
  adding a new dependency version bump; re-verify against crates.io if it's
  been a while since the plan was written, especially for `typst-as-lib` /
  `typst-bake` (both explicitly unstable upstream) and anything with a large
  major-version gap.

## Useful commands

(To be filled in once the project is scaffolded — build, run, test, lint.)
